# Python 3 Exercises – Curso em Vídeo

This repository contains all the programming exercises I completed while studying Python 3 through the **Curso em Vídeo** YouTube series, taught by prof. Gustavo Guanabara.

## 📚 About the Course

The course is structured into three main modules:

- **Mundo 1**: Fundamentals  
- **Mundo 2**: Control Structures  
- **Mundo 3**: Data Structures  

Each module includes dozens of video lessons and corresponding exercises, covering the foundations of Python programming in a hands-on, practical way.

## 🧠 My Learning Process

At first, I completed all **115 exercises** in **Portuguese**, following the lessons step by step. Later, after learning the basics of Git and GitHub—also through the Curso em Vídeo Git course—I decided to **redo all the exercises in English** as a way to:

- Reinforce my understanding of Python
- Challenge myself linguistically
- Practice version control using both local and remote repositories  

I'm gradually uploading each solution here, following my own logic and structure while keeping the core objectives of the original exercises.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code / PyCharm (IDE)

## 🚀 Goals

- Solidify foundational programming concepts  
- Improve fluency in both English and technical writing  
- Build a consistent and public study routine
